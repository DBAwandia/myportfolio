                  <p>I created this app, it works like a banking app.
                    Users can <b>Send</b> and <b>Receive</b>
                    money by just one tap transaction.
                    There is also a savings plan where user can set their goal and start savings for it.
                    Deposits are many via Credit cards on deposit.
                    Soon will introduce virtual cards ðŸŽ¯
